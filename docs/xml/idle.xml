  <body>
The idle() function is like the sleep() function with an infinite sleep time.  
In general, if you are using the idle() function, you should probably be using return() instead.
DO NOT USE IDLE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR return!!!  
A return from a method which was called from an incoming message will also put the instance back in a IDLE state.
