Revision 1.2  2003/04/16 01:45:14  bergsma
Freeze 3.1.2.  Prepared for Form Factor.  The -n option is used to give
hyperscripts on VMS a loopback channel as the means for incoming mailbox
AST to notify hyperscipt of a message arrival, ie: to unblock the
select() call.  This is specific to VMS.

Revision 1.1  2003/04/16 01:41:38  bergsma
Message Routing
---------------
Lift the restriction whereby a hyperscript which specifies a default listen
socket with the -n switch does not also have to be the root,
ie: specify the -r switch.
The restriction has been moved to gHyp_router_message,
whereby messages that need to be routed to another host are only sent
out on the "-n" socket channel if that hyperscript is also the root.
Files affected: hs.c and router.c
