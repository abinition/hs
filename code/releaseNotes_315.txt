Functions
--------------------
Problem with merge() and autoincrement feature, was not auto-incrementing properly.

Language Features
-----------------
Added new binary operator **, example: 5**3 == 125

Unicode support
---------------
Added new typedef 'unicode', UTF-16.
Required for new unicode type:
1. New data type in data object
2. Special unicode output for xdescribe function
3. New TYPE_UNICODE in hypdef.h
4. New token 0uNNNNN format, like 0xNNNNN and 0oNNNNN
5. New function unicode()
6. New SECS II data type.


Bug Fixes
---------
pValue1 and pValue2 need to be set to NULL after warnings so that
the loop in operator_binary will break out.

PROMIS
------
Added stats.c to build_hs.com
In the batch function, fix the problem whereby the OPTION_AUTO process 
logical gets set to NO and then it is never deleted, so that the next
time the batch function is run, automation does no come up.
