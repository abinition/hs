Unprintable Characters in Strings
---------------------------------
Values created from a incoming message data was not retaining unprintable characters
if for example, the string ended in \000.  
Values created from parsed XML also need to retain unprintable characters.
When a character value is above ~, then consider this "unprintable".

Bugs in Functions
-----------------
1. In strtok(), the setToken() was replaced with setStr2
2. In load(), an extra argument specifies the maximum number of lines to load.
3. In sdescribe() and xsdescribe(), extra spaces are removed from the output.
4. In detach(), after moving the values from a source variable into a 
destination variable, the source variable must be detached before it is
deleted. 
5. For all functions that use data_moveValues, the destination values
are deleted before the new ones are moved in.

Messages
--------
When incoming messages contained structured variables, the dereference function broke
because the FRAME_GLOBAL_MSGARGS flag did not get reset.

Parsing XML
-----------
The xml  parse function was broke.  The argument pValue in gHyp_cgi_parseXML needed to
be a pointer so that it can be updated within the recursion of the parsing.  This 
bug affected only parsing of XML strings, xsdescribe(), xml()

PROMIS
-----
1. Needed to separate MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH from PROMIS restriction of
MAX_TERMINAL_LENGTH, which can only be 256.  This limitation caused
problems in code where MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH was used.
2. Remove hardcoding of "MBX" in START.COM, replace with AUTOFIFO translation.
3. When parsing TRES, the status return value was not being tested properly,
as a result the tres varables would not be exposed.
