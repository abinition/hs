			Release Notes for HS 3.2.1

PROMIS

	When doing pexec(), tut_output does a callback to 
	aeqSsp_automan_putline which adds the line to the
	hyperscript variable '_promis_data_'.




Bugs Fixed:


1. HTML unicode is &#ddddd; where ddddd is 5 digit decimal

2. OpenVMS 'fread' function fails to detect correct end-of-file.
   Made load_binary function do an fstat on the file to get the
   size prior to reading the file so that proper eof is verified.
