			Release Notes for HS 3.2.2

Bugs Fixed:

     For write operations, detect EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK, return 0 instead of -1

     For PROMIS, in the CONFIG_TEMPLATE.COM, an invalid username sets the 
     automation logicals to default values - JOB only, not GROUP.

     For data coming into a port, set it to REPLY data only if there is
     and outstanding query on the same port.

     For line-based HTTP data (text/plan, text/xml, text/html), provide
     knitting of lines between chunks of data read, also accomodate lines
     larger than INTERNAL_VALUE_SIZE if they really would be represented
     externall in VALUE_SIZE space.
